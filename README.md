# Overview
The project aims to implement an efficient indexing approach for spatiotemporal datasets, specifically using the methodology described in the paper "Indexing Moving Object Trajectories With Hilbert Curves." The implementation will focus on processing a Twitter dataset within the Apache Sedona framework, comparing traditional spatial indexing methods with Hilbert curve-based transformations. This project demonstrates how to leverage Apache Spark and Sedona (formerly GeoSpark) for geospatial data processing. It provides a comprehensive setup guide, detailed instructions, and code examples using Jupyter Notebooks. Designed for users interested in geospatial analytics and scalable big data processing.

# Features
1. Installation of Apache Sedona: Successfully downloaded and installed Apache Sedona, a cluster computing system for large-scale spatial data processing.
2. Data Preparation: Read the Twitter dataset and prepare it for processing.
3. Spatial Partitioning and Indexing: Implemented spatial partitioning of the dataset across worker nodes and build an R-Tree index for efficient querying.
3. Range Query Execution: Performed range queries with time filters to identify tweets within specified spatial and temporal bounds, reporting the running time of these queries.

# Setup
- To set up the project, follow these steps: Java
- Download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK). Ensure it is added to your system's PATH.
- Download and configure Apache Spark. Verify compatibility with your JVM version.
- Add Apache Sedona dependencies to your Spark environment. These can be configured via the spark-submit command or environment settings.
- Install Python Dependencies
- Use pip to install required Python libraries:
- pip install pyspark sedona-python-adapter
- Run the Notebook
- Open the provided Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells in order.

# Usage
- This project covers:
1. Installing and configuring Apache Spark and Sedona.
2. Performing geospatial operations, including: Spatial joins, Distance calculations, Spatial querying.
3. Processing large-scale geospatial datasets using Spark's distributed computing.

# Resume descripton
1. Implemented spatial partitioning of the dataset across worker nodes and build an R-Tree index for efficient querying.
2. Performed range queries with time filters to identify tweets within specified spatial and temporal bounds, reporting the running time of these queries.
3. Implemented the transformation of each spatiotemporal point (x, y, t) into a 2D data point (H(x, y), t) using Hilbert curve values for the spatial coordinates.
4. Executeed refined range queries of the form [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (t1, t2)], applying a two-step filtering process to enhance query accuracy and efficiency.
5. Reported the running time and the percentage of spurious points returned during the filtering step.

# Outcome
The project will culminate in a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of Hilbert curve-based indexing in managing large-scale spatiotemporal data, providing insights into its advantages over traditional spatial indexing methods.
   
# Example Use Cases
1. Urban Planning: Analyze city infrastructure using geospatial data.
2. Environmental Studies: Perform large-scale environmental data analytics.
3. Logistics and Routing: Optimize routes and logistics with spatial data queries.
