# Overview
This project demonstrates how to leverage Apache Spark and Sedona (formerly GeoSpark) for geospatial data processing. It provides a comprehensive setup guide, detailed instructions, and code examples using Jupyter Notebooks. Designed for users interested in geospatial analytics and scalable big data processing.

# Features
1. Integration with Java: Set up the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) required for Apache Spark and Sedona.
2. Apache Sedona: Perform advanced geospatial operations.
3. Big Data Processing: Utilize Apache Spark for distributed computation on large datasets.
4. Notebook-based Workflow: Execute all tasks seamlessly in a Jupyter Notebook.
5. Scalable Analytics: Implement efficient geospatial workflows for massive datasets.

# Setup
- To set up the project, follow these steps:

Install Java
- Download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK). Ensure it is added to your system's PATH.

## Install Apache Spark
- Download and configure Apache Spark. Verify compatibility with your JVM version.

## Install Sedona
- Add Apache Sedona dependencies to your Spark environment. These can be configured via the spark-submit command or environment settings.

## Install Python Dependencies
- Use pip to install required Python libraries:
- pip install pyspark sedona-python-adapter
- Run the Notebook
- Open the provided Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells in order.

# Usage
This project covers:

1. Installing and configuring Apache Spark and Sedona.
2. Performing geospatial operations, including: Spatial joins, Distance calculations, Spatial querying.
3. Processing large-scale geospatial datasets using Spark's distributed computing.
   
# Example Use Cases
1. Urban Planning: Analyze city infrastructure using geospatial data.
